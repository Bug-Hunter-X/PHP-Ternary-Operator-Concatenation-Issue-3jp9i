This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to using the ternary operator within an echo statement. The problem arises when attempting to concatenate strings and variables within the ternary expression, leading to unexpected results or parse errors.

```php
<?php
$name = 'John';
$age = 30;
echo "Your name is: " . ($name == 'John' ? "$name" : 'Guest') . " and your age is: " . $age;
?>
```

The issue is that the variable `$name` within the double quotes inside the ternary operator is not properly interpolated when the condition evaluates to true. While it may appear to work in some contexts, it can lead to unpredictable behavior or parse errors, especially if complex expressions are used within the ternary operator.
